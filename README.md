### Hey üëã, I'm Aron :) 

I've been [developing open source software](https://aron-homberg.de/projects) since my teens. When I'm not programming, I'm producing [music](https://aron-homberg.de/music). Maybe you're stranded here because you're a happy user of my open source projects, one of my programming students, a developer, producer, or fan.

If that's the case, please consider buying me a coffee:
