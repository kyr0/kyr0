### Hi üëã, I'm Aron

> ...with 20+ years of experience, I'm a seasoned software engineer who also enjoys indulging in writing, teaching and music production during my free time.
 
- üõ†Ô∏è These days, I'm building AI-driven web apps, libraries and software engineering tools
- üî¨ I‚Äôm into: LLMs, GPTs, vector databases, ensemble AI based time-series forecasting, N-HiTS and RLHF 
- üî¨ Novel algorithms and computer science / research projects I've finished:
  - [vectorstore](https://github.com/kyr0/vectorstore/tree/main) - Local, cost-free vector store for text embeddings and similarity search in-browser and Node.js.
  - [clientside-search](https://github.com/kyr0/clientside-search) - "Lucene in the browser + Node.js"; highly efficient, isomorphic, full-featured, multilingual text search engine library, providing full-text search, fuzzy matching, document indexing and more
  - [offline-geocode-city](https://github.com/kyr0/offline-geocode-city) - smallest and fastest offline reverse geocoder for country/city on NPM, in-browser, Node.js, service worker, using S2 cell geometry
  - [@jsheaven/perf](https://github.com/jsheaven/perf) - an algorithm to estimate the average runtime and time-complexity (big O notation) of (a)sync algorithms in JavaScript/TypeScript projects
  - [brotli-unicode](https://github.com/kyr0/brotli-unicode) - a novel algorithm for encoding/decoding and character level compression/decompression with character-level compression rates of >500%. The compressed data is copy-pasteable without data loss
  - [base-unicode](https://github.com/kyr0/base-unicode) - a novel algorithm for encoding/decoding in a Unicode symbol plane that makes use of printable characters of all kinds of languages; this allows for thousands of symbols to be used instead of only 64 like in base64
- üåü Recently completed apps/websites:
  - [bootsector.games](https://bootsector.games) - learning and experimenting with NASM x86 assembly and bootsector game development in-browser; implemented the `INT3` step-debugging instruction in the Rust-based v86   - 
  - [milkymilky.rpcks](https://milkymilky.rocks) - WinAmp style, shader based music visualization, rendered on the GPU wie WebGL/WebGPU in Electron
- üìö My top completed JavaScript/TypeScript libraries/frameworks/developer tools:
  - [@jsheaven/easybuild](https://github.com/jsheaven/easybuild) - `esbuild` based, super-fast and easy IIFE, ESM and CJS bundler for JS and TS; primarily for libraries, API- and CLI projects
  - [@jsheaven/create-from-git](https://github.com/jsheaven/create-from-git) - scaffolds a new project using `git checkout` and smart, in-file string replacements. Comes with an API and CLI: `npx create-from-git`. Runs on Mac, Windows and Linux.
  - [@jsheaven/simply-persist](https://github.com/jsheaven/simply-persist) - simple, solid CRUD-only client-side storage with session/localStorage persistency
  - [@jsheaven/observed](https://github.com/jsheaven/observed) - explicit, `Proxy`-based reactive pattern implementation for objects of any depth
  - [@jsheaven/validalli](https://github.com/jsheaven/validalli) - functional, well-tested, framework-agnostic (form) validation library based on the composition pattern
- ‚öíÔ∏è Re-implemented for educational purposes ("True knowledge lies in creation")
  - [vanil](https://github.com/kyr0/vanil) - static website builder similar to [Astro.build](https://astro.build), Next.js and Gatsby
  - [@sprintype-org/springtype](https://github.com/springtype-org/springtype) - a 4k nano-framework with a Virtual DOM implementation and React-like features; [Colivery](https://github.com/colivery) is built with it
  - [nes-ui-react](https://github.com/kyr0/nes-ui-react) - a SASS/SCSS design framework for an 8-bit UI reminisence look and feel, re-implemented the patterns of prominent UI frameworks; [bootsector.games](https://bootsector.games) is built with it
  - [Extanium2](https://github.com/kyr0/Extanium2) - open-source re-implementation of ExtJS 4
