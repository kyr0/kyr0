### Hi üëã, I'm Aron

> I‚Äôm a systems thinker and software engineer with a deep focus on solving hard, often overlooked problems - especially in areas like web development, algorithm design, low-level optimization, language engineering, and applied AI. My work is driven by a simple principle: **build things that are genuinely useful and intellectually honest.**

> Over the years, I‚Äôve created and contributed to a wide range of client projects, OSS libraries, tools, and demos that push technical boundaries - from web frameworks, ultra-fast math libraries, and compact NLP systems for hybrid search and language identification, to encoders/decoders, domain-specific languages (DSLs), browser extensions, PWAs, agentic graph-reasoning workflows, and advanced multicore WebAssembly or JIT-optimized solutions for the web platform.

> I value *clarity*, *correctness*, and *elegance* over trends or hype - and prefer deep, focused work over shallow visibility.

> If you‚Äôre here because something I built helped you - or something I posted inspired you - that‚Äôs the best outcome I could hope for.

    - [NeuraForge.de](https://neuraforge.de) - Reliable deepfake detection.
    - [KI.M](https://medien-bayern.de/ki-kompetenzzentrum-medien) - Prototyping advanced AI applications for media houses.
    - [HYOBAN.ai](https://hyoban.ai) - Professional, AI-driven review management, analytics & competitor monitoring.
- üî¨ Current focus interest: 
    1. Agentic systems, vector databases, NLP algorithms
    2. High performance web tech (WebAssembly, SIMD, WebGPU, JIT optimization & co.), Rust-based multicore WebAssembly ports (prev. Emscripten/C)
    3. LLMs, GPTs, RLHF, GRPO, QLoRA, ... (every non-vapor-paper)
    4. ASTs, stack-based executors, DSLs
    5. NLP/search algos, tokenizers, encoders
    6. High performance audio synthesis, routing, sampling, mixing, and analysis algorithms
    7. Web frameworks (see my work on [`defuss`](https://github.com/kyr0/defuss), which re-invents the whole frontend web-tech wheel)
- üî¨ Novel algorithms and computer science / research projects I'm working on:
  - [langdetect-ts](https://github.com/kyr0/langdetect-ts) - Port of Google LangDetect, the state-of-the-art language ngram-based language detection (identification) library to TypeScript. Used in `liquiprompt` and RedakTool.

  - [vectorstore](https://github.com/kyr0/vectorstore/) - In-browser, vector store featuring very fast vector indexing, storage, serialization, product quantization and search (exact, kMeans, HNSW) balancing search quality and memory/computational constraints. Backbone of RedakTool's archive and NewsRadar topic following algorithm. Also used in `liquiprompt` for few-shot optimized exemplars.
  - [quality-prompts-js](https://github.com/kyr0/quality-prompts-js) - Write Quality Prompts using auto-optimization. Use and evaluate prompting techniques quickly. Learnings used in `liquiprompt` for automatic prompt optimizations.
  - [liquiprompt](https://github.com/kyr0/liquiprompt) - The prompt language used in RedakTool. Simple but powerful prompt and RAG workflow templating language (DSL) featuring D(A/C)G parse/test/run orchestration.
  - [clientside-search](https://github.com/kyr0/clientside-search) - "Lucene in the browser + Node.js"; highly efficient, isomorphic, full-featured, multilingual text search engine library, providing full-text search, fuzzy matching, document indexing and more
  - [easy-embeddings](https://github.com/kyr0/easy-embeddings) - In-browser vector embeddings made easy using WebGPU and WebAssembly acceleration. 
  - [cross-llm](https://github.com/kyr0/cross-llm) - Abstract LLM/vector embedding implementation. A universal library to integrate with LLMs and Vector Embedding endpoints. Supports Node.js, Deno, Bun, Service Workers, Web Extensions. [Status September 2024: In rewrite to wrap @vercel/ai]
  - [offline-geocode-city](https://github.com/kyr0/offline-geocode-city) - smallest and fastest offline reverse geocoder for country/city on NPM, in-browser, Node.js, service worker, using S2 cell geometry

  - [brotli-unicode](https://github.com/kyr0/brotli-unicode) - a novel algorithm for encoding/decoding and character level compression/decompression with character-level compression rates of >500%. The compressed data is copy-pasteable without data loss
  - [base-unicode](https://github.com/kyr0/base-unicode) - a novel algorithm for encoding/decoding in a Unicode symbol plane that makes use of printable characters of all kinds of languages; this allows for thousands of symbols to be used instead of only 64 like in base64
