### Hey 👋, I'm Aron :) 
## a software engineer and writer who is interested in music

I’ve been developing [software](https://aron-homberg.de/projects) since my teens (that’s 25+ years now). 
You can ask me basically anything about web development. 
When I’m not programming, I’m probably producing [music](https://aron-homberg.de/music).

If I was able to help you or if you happen to be a user of my software products or libraries, please consider a small donation:

...as building all this is quite cost intensive in subscription fees, software licenses and tools.

Thank you!! ☺️
