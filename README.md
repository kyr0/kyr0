### Hi 👋, I'm Aron

> ...with 25+ years of experience, I'm a seasoned software engineer who also enjoys indulging in writing, teaching and music production during my free time.
 
- 🌐 These days, I'm building AI-driven web apps, libraries and software engineering tools
- 🔬 I’m into: LLMs, GPTs, vector databases, ensemble AI based time-series forecasting, N-HiTS and RLHF too 
- 🌐 My top recently completed apps/websites:
  - [bootsector.games](https://bootsector.games) - learning and experimenting with NASM x86 assembly and bootsector game development in-browser; implemented the `INT3` step-debugging instruction in the Rust-based v86 emulator; using `broti-unicode` and 
  - [milkymilky.rocks](https://milkymilky.rocks) - the good old Winamp/Geiss music visualisation app - for Mac, Windows, Linux, using WebGL and shaders, based on Electron
- 📚 My top completed JavaScript/TypeScript libraries/frameworks/developer tools:
  - [@jsheaven/easybuild](https://github.com/jsheaven/easybuild) - `esbuild` based, super-fast and easy IIFE, ESM and CJS bundler for JS and TS; primarily for libraries, API- and CLI projects
  - [@jsheaven/create-from-git](https://github.com/jsheaven/create-from-git) - scaffolds a new project using `git checkout` and smart, in-file string replacements. Comes with an API and CLI: `npx create-from-git`. Runs on Mac, Windows and Linux.
  - [@jsheaven/simply-persist](https://github.com/jsheaven/simply-persist) - simple, solid CRUD-only client-side storage with session/localStorage persistency
  - [@jsheaven/observed](https://github.com/jsheaven/observed) - explicit, `Proxy`-based reactive pattern implementation for objects of any depth
  - [@jsheaven/validalli](https://github.com/jsheaven/validalli) - functional, well-tested, framework-agnostic (form) validation library based on the composition pattern
- 🔬 My top novel algorithms and computer science / research projects:
  - [clientside-search](https://github.com/kyr0/clientside-search) - "Lucene in the browser + Node.js"; highly efficient, isomorphic, full-featured, multilingual text search engine library, providing full-text search, fuzzy matching, document indexing and more
  - [offline-geocode-city](https://github.com/kyr0/offline-geocode-city) - smallest and fastest offline reverse geocoder for country/city on NPM, in-browser, Node.js, service worker, using S2 cell geometry
  - [@jsheaven/perf](https://github.com/jsheaven/perf) - an algorithm to estimate the average runtime and time-complexity (big O notation) of (a)sync algorithms in JavaScript/TypeScript projects
  - [brotli-unicode](https://github.com/kyr0/brotli-unicode) - a novel algorithm for encoding/decoding and character level compression/decompression with character-level compression rates of >500%. The compressed data is copy-pasteable without data loss
  - [base-unicode](https://github.com/kyr0/base-unicode) - a novel algorithm for encoding/decoding in a Unicode symbol plane that makes use of printable characters of all kinds of languages; this allows for thousands of symbols to be used instead of only 64 like in base64
