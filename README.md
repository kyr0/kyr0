### Hi üëã, I'm Aron

> I‚Äôm a systems thinker and software engineer with a deep focus on solving hard, often overlooked problems - especially in areas like web development, algorithm design, low-level optimization, language engineering, and applied AI. My work is driven by a simple principle: **build things that are genuinely useful and intellectually honest.**

> Over the years, I‚Äôve created and contributed to a wide range of client projects, OSS libraries, tools, and demos that push technical boundaries - from web frameworks, ultra-fast math libraries, and compact NLP systems for hybrid search and language identification, to encoders/decoders, domain-specific languages (DSLs), browser extensions, PWAs, agentic graph-reasoning workflows, and advanced multicore WebAssembly or JIT-optimized solutions for the web platform.

> I value *clarity*, *correctness*, and *elegance* over trends or hype - and prefer deep, focused work over shallow visibility.

> If you‚Äôre here because something I built helped you - or something I posted inspired you - that‚Äôs the best outcome I could hope for.
