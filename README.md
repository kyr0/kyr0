### Hey üëã, I'm Aron :) 

I've been [developing free software](https://aron-homberg.de/projects) since my teens, and when I'm not programming, I'm probably producing [free music for you](https://aron-homberg.de/music).

Maybe you're stranded here because you're a happy user of my free software, one of my programming students, a developer, or a fan.

If that's the case, please consider buying me a coffee:

Thank you!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
